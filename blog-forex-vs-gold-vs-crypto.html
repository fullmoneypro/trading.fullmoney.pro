  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section class="page-intro">
    <h1>Forex vs Gold vs Crypto</h1>
    <p>
      Forex, gold, and cryptocurrency are among the most popular trading markets.
      Each market behaves differently and carries its own risks.
      This guide helps beginners understand the key differences
      before choosing where to focus their learning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FOREX -->
  <section>
    <h2>Forex Trading</h2>
    <p>
      Forex (foreign exchange) is the market where currencies are traded.
      It is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world.
      Major currency pairs such as EUR/USD or USD/JPY
      often move smoothly compared to other markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forex is popular among beginners because of
      high liquidity, tight spreads, and flexible trading hours.
      However, leverage can increase both profits and losses.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- GOLD -->
  <section>
    <h2>Gold Trading</h2>
    <p>
      Gold is considered a safe-haven asset
      and is often traded during times of economic uncertainty.
      Gold prices are influenced by inflation,
      interest rates, and global geopolitical events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to Forex, gold can be more volatile
      during news events and market shocks.
      It requires patience and careful risk management.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CRYPTO -->
  <section>
    <h2>Cryptocurrency Trading</h2>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
      are digital assets known for high volatility.
      Prices can move significantly within short periods,
      creating both opportunities and risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crypto markets operate 24/7
      and are heavily influenced by sentiment, regulation,
      and technological developments.
      Beginners should approach crypto with caution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- COMPARISON -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Differences at a Glance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Forex is the most liquid, crypto the least.</li>
      <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Crypto is highly volatile, Forex relatively stable.</li>
      <li><strong>Trading Hours:</strong> Crypto trades 24/7, Forex follows sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Level:</strong> All markets carry risk, but crypto is the most unpredictable.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- WHICH IS BEST -->
  <section>
    <h2>Which Market Is Best for Beginners?</h2>
    <p>
      There is no single best market for everyone.
      Forex is often recommended for beginners
      due to its liquidity and structured behavior.
      Gold suits traders interested in macroeconomic factors,
      while crypto requires strong risk awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginners should focus on learning one market first
      instead of jumping between multiple instruments.
