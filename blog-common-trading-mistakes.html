  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section class="page-intro">
    <h1>Common Trading Mistakes Beginners Make</h1>
    <p>
      Most traders do not fail because trading is impossible,
      but because they repeat the same mistakes.
      Understanding common trading errors early
      can help beginners avoid unnecessary losses.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OVERTRADING -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overtrading</h2>
    <p>
      Overtrading happens when traders open too many positions
      without clear reasons.
      This often occurs due to boredom, fear of missing out,
      or the desire to recover losses quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trading less but with higher-quality setups
      is usually more effective than trading frequently.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- NO RISK MANAGEMENT -->
  <section>
    <h2>Ignoring Risk Management</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most dangerous mistakes is risking too much
      on a single trade.
      Without proper risk management,
      even a few losing trades can wipe out an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professional traders focus on protecting capital first,
      not maximizing profits.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- EMOTIONAL TRADING -->
  <section>
    <h2>Emotional Trading</h2>
    <p>
      Fear, greed, and frustration strongly affect trading decisions.
      Emotional trading often leads to impulsive entries,
      early exits, or revenge trading after losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developing discipline and following a plan
      is essential for long-term consistency.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- NO PLAN -->
  <section>
    <h2>Trading Without a Plan</h2>
    <p>
      Many beginners enter trades without knowing
      where to exit for profit or loss.
      Trading without a plan turns decision-making
      into guesswork rather than strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple trading plan helps maintain consistency
      and reduces emotional mistakes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Unrealistic Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      Social media often promotes the idea
      that trading leads to fast and easy profits.
      This creates unrealistic expectations for beginners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, trading is a long-term learning process,
      and progress takes time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW TO AVOID -->
  <section>
    <h2>How to Avoid These Mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on learning before risking money</li>
      <li>Use proper risk management on every trade</li>
      <li>Trade with a clear plan</li>
      <li>Accept losses as part of the process</li>
    </ul>
