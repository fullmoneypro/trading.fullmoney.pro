  <!-- WHAT ARE INDICATORS -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="Why-These-Trading-Indicators-Are-Best-for-Beginners">Why These Trading Indicators Are Best for Beginners</h2>
    <p>
      Trading indicators are mathematical calculations based on price,
      volume, or volatility.
      They are designed to help traders interpret market behavior,
      not to predict the future with certainty.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- EMA -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="ema">Moving Averages (EMA)</h2>
    <p>
      Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) smooth price data
      to help identify trend direction.
      EMAs react faster to recent price changes compared to simple moving averages,
      making them popular for trend analysis.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- RSI -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="rsi">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h2>
    <p>
      RSI measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes
      to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
      It is often used to assess momentum rather than precise entry points.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ATR -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="atr">Average True Range (ATR)</h2>
    <p>
      ATR measures market volatility.
      It does not indicate direction, but helps traders understand
      how much price typically moves within a given period.
      ATR is commonly used for position sizing and stop-loss placement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- COMBINING INDICATORS -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="combine">Combining Indicators</h2>
    <p>
      Indicators are most effective when used together with
      price action and market context.
      Combining indicators that measure different aspects
      (trend, momentum, volatility) can provide more balanced insights.
    </p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Educational Note:</strong>
      Using too many indicators often leads to confusion.
      Clarity comes from understanding market structure,
      not from adding more tools.
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- MISTAKES -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="mistakes">Common Indicator Mistakes</h2>
    <p>
      Many beginners misuse indicators by treating them as signals
      rather than analytical tools.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Relying on indicators without understanding price action</li>
      <li>Using too many indicators on one chart</li>
      <li>Ignoring market conditions and volatility</li>
      <li>Expecting indicators to predict exact market turns</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- NEXT STEP -->
  <section class="page-next">
    <p>
      Indicators support strategy execution, but success also depends
      on mindset and emotional control.
