  <!-- WHAT IS TRADING -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="what-is">What Is Trading?</h2>
    <p>
      Trading is the activity of buying and selling financial instruments such as currencies,
      commodities, or cryptocurrencies to benefit from price movements.
      Unlike long-term investing, trading usually focuses on shorter timeframes
      and requires active decision-making.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW TRADING WORKS -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="how-works">How Trading Works</h2>
    <p>
      Traders speculate on price movements using a broker platform.
      You can buy (long) when expecting prices to rise, or sell (short)
      when expecting prices to fall.
      Profit and loss depend on market movement, position size,
      and how risk is managed.
    </p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Educational Note:</strong>
      Understanding how trading works does not guarantee profit.
      Trading always involves risk, and education helps traders
      make more informed decisions.
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- MARKETS -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="markets">Forex vs Gold vs Crypto</h2>
    <p>
      Forex, gold, and crypto are popular trading markets, but each behaves differently.
      Forex markets are highly liquid, gold is often used as a hedge or safe-haven asset,
      and cryptocurrencies tend to experience higher volatility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CAPITAL -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="capital">How Much Capital Do You Need?</h2>
    <p>
      There is no fixed minimum capital required to start trading.
      What matters more is understanding risk and position sizing.
      Beginners are encouraged to start with demo accounts
      or small capital while focusing on learning rather than profit.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SESSIONS -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="sessions">Trading Sessions and Market Time</h2>
    <p>
      Financial markets operate in different sessions such as Asian, London,
      and New York sessions.
      Knowing when markets are most active helps traders avoid low-volatility periods
      and manage trades more effectively.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MISTAKES -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="mistakes">Common Beginner Mistakes</h2>
    <p>
      Many beginners struggle not because of strategy,
      but because of poor risk control and unrealistic expectations.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Overtrading without a clear plan</li>
      <li>Ignoring risk management rules</li>
      <li>Chasing losses after losing trades</li>
      <li>Relying on signals without understanding logic</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- NEXT STEP -->
  <section class="page-next">
    <p>
      Once you understand the basics, the next step is learning
      how trading strategies work in real market conditions.
