    <h1>Trading Psychology</h1>
    <p>
      Trading psychology focuses on how emotions, mindset, and discipline
      influence trading decisions.
      Even with a solid strategy, poor psychological control can lead to
      inconsistent results.

  <!-- WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="what-is">What Is Trading Psychology?</h2>
    <p>
      Trading psychology refers to the emotional and mental factors
      that affect trading decisions.
      It includes how traders react to wins and losses,
      manage stress, and maintain discipline over time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- FEAR & GREED -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="fear-greed">Fear and Greed in Trading</h2>
    <p>
      Fear and greed are two dominant emotions in trading.
      Fear can prevent traders from entering valid setups,
      while greed may cause them to overtrade or hold positions too long.
    </p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Psychology Insight:</strong>
      Emotional reactions are normal.
      The goal is not to eliminate emotions,
      but to prevent them from controlling trading decisions.
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- HANDLING LOSSES -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="handling-losses">Handling Losing Trades</h2>
    <p>
      Losses are a natural part of trading.
      Successful traders accept losses as part of the process
      and focus on execution quality rather than individual trade outcomes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Accept losses as business expenses</li>
      <li>Avoid revenge trading after a loss</li>
      <li>Review mistakes objectively</li>
      <li>Stick to predefined risk limits</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DISCIPLINE -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="discipline">Discipline and Consistency</h2>
    <p>
      Discipline means following a trading plan consistently,
      even during periods of drawdown.
      Consistency in execution is often more important
      than finding the perfect strategy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OVERTRADING -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="overtrading">Avoiding Overtrading</h2>
    <p>
      Overtrading occurs when traders take too many trades
      without valid setups.
      This behavior is often driven by boredom, frustration,
      or the desire to recover losses quickly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- LONG TERM -->
  <section>
    <h2 id="long-term">Thinking Long Term</h2>
    <p>
      Trading success is measured over a series of trades,
      not individual outcomes.
      Focusing on long-term performance helps traders
      stay calm during short-term fluctuations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- NEXT STEP -->
  <section class="page-next">
    <p>
      Psychology supports strategy execution and indicator usage.
      Strong mental discipline helps traders apply their knowledge consistently.
