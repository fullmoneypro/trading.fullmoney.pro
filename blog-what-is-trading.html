  <!-- ARTICLE INTRO -->
  <section class="page-intro">
    <h1>What Is Tradin for Beginners?</h1>
    <p>
      Trading is one of the most talked-about financial activities today,
      yet many beginners misunderstand what it really means.
      This guide explains trading in a clear and realistic way —
      without hype or promises.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONTENT -->
  <section>
    <h2>Definition of Trading</h2>
    <p>
      Trading is the activity of buying and selling financial instruments
      such as currencies, commodities, stocks, or cryptocurrencies
      with the goal of benefiting from price movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike investing, which often focuses on long-term value,
      trading usually operates on shorter timeframes
      and requires active decision-making.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Trading Works</h2>
    <p>
      Traders participate in the market through a broker platform.
      When you believe a price will rise, you buy (go long).
      When you expect a price to fall, you sell (go short).
    </p>
    <p>
      Profit and loss depend on price movement,
      position size, and how well risk is managed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Popular Trading Markets</h2>
    <p>
      There are several markets where trading commonly takes place:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Forex:</strong> Currency trading with high liquidity.</li>
      <li><strong>Gold:</strong> Often used as a hedge during uncertainty.</li>
      <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Highly volatile digital assets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each market behaves differently and requires
      proper understanding before trading real money.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Is Trading Easy?</h2>
    <p>
      Trading looks simple on the surface,
      but consistent profitability is difficult.
      Many beginners fail because they underestimate risk,
      overtrade, or focus only on profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successful traders treat trading as a skill
      that requires time, discipline, and continuous learning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Education Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Education helps traders understand market behavior,
      manage risk properly, and avoid emotional decisions.
      Without education, trading often becomes gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why beginner traders should focus on learning first
      before risking real capital.
